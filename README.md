# srsf_web_framework
Small and responsive CSS framework for fast construction of decriptive illustrated text web sites (blogs, documentation, scientific articles, portfolios etc.)

Yeah, sometimes we just need a web-site. No dancing with CMS, no need of huge publishing system, etc. Just a web-site.
We are ready to write down some HTML. But we want this site to be responsive by default and we want to save some time by reusing common site blocks like navigation, paragraph or graphic illustration with captions.

This is what SRSF is for. You can easily deploy a web site by copying and pasting pre-styled blocks. If you need a text article, place it. If you need an illustration, paste it in place. If you need one more illustration, just duplicate it and change the image source.
CSS framework will care about the rest. All blocks are cross-browser compatible and will fit most of modern screens - desktop, tablet and mobile as well.
Yeah, it's just a CSS framework. There is no automation for text editing or images placement. You will need to think about folders, script (if needed), version control etc.
However, you will be able to deploy responsive sites at a pretty quick pace.

You can use SRSF for small technological pages, home pages, small business web-sites or personal portfolio. You can also integrate it in a CMS or an existing web-site to use its means of automation.

Please, enjoy! And have your projects done in time!
Thank you so much!
